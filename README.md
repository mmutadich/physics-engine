## Physics Engine

A versatile physics engine which uses foundational elements like bodies and scenes that interact through collisions and forces. It also doubles as a physics sandbox, where users can experiment with simulations and observe the real-time impacts of different physical phenomena. Created by Mia Mutadich, Jena Alsup, Ava Penn and Meher Banik (Spring 2023)
