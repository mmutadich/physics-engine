## Physics Engine

A versatile physics engine that uses foundational elements like bodies and scenes, which interact through collisions and forces. This platform enabled us to develop a variety of games, including classics like Pacman and Space Invaders, as well as our final projectâ€”a two-player cooperative game titled 'Plant Boy and Dirt Girl,' created by Mia Mutadich, Jena Alsup, Ava Penn, and Meher Banik. Additionally, the engine doubles as a physics sandbox, allowing users to experiment with simulations and observe the real-time impacts of different physical phenomena. (Spring 2023)
